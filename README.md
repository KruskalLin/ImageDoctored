# ImageDoctored

Create dirs first.

```shell
mkdir bounding_detect
mkdir configs
```
Rename the boxing images directory to 'area'. Rename the original images directory to 'class' then rename every subdirectory according to alphabet order.

There are three types of manipulation: slicing, copy-move, removal. Run generate_configs() first then run them.
